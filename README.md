Hamster Hotel
Created a responsive hamster hotel website based upon a prototype using bootstrap.
Peer reviewed by: Avery Hillstrom
Peer review comments: Website is extremely clean; desktop, tablet, and mobile version are all organized and reformatted depending on the user's screen size. I thought the choice to remove most of the hamster images on the mobile version was very interesting- the text-only look is much neater but you lose a little of the advertising elements on the website. I was very impressed that the amenities and reserve sections kept their structure when moved from desktop to mobile. The default (desktop) layout looks exactly the same as the prototype- the only differences I could discern is the amenities icons being more spread out, and the reserve section of the Navbar. Rather than Reserve having its own border box, all navbar items have a border box that appears on hover, which I thought was very clever. Overall fantastic job! :)
